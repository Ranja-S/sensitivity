# sensitivity

Selecting a dataset size for machine learning is a challenging open problem. Typically, there is a strong relationship between training dataset size and model performance, especially for nonlinear models.

A sensitivuty analysis forms the basis for testing different model types and model configurations in addition to the ones chosen at the outset. This helps in evaluating a better model algorithm to address a given problem and decide on a rough estimate of the training data needed to build the predictive model, apart from the statistical heuristics such as number of classes (classification problem), number of input features or the number of model parameters that are considered.
